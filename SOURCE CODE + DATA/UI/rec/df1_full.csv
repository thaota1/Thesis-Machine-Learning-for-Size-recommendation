About me: I am 5'8' and 141 lbs. I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs. 

RE: FIT/STRETCH. Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size. So, if you are a 4/6 girl (like me), order the 6. Whereas, if you're a 4/6 girl and you've been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you'll be able to wear the 4.  I ordered both!  I was worried I wouldn't be able to sit in this, but I was able to sit just fine, in both the 4 and 6.  I was ""worried"" that the sleeves wouldn't fit my arms (I do back/bi and chest/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!

RE: LENGTH/SEXINESS. I felt that the dress was appropriately long. By today's trends, most gals would say it's way too long. And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman. However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it's illusion top and glittery ""burnt"" rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).  From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale. The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn't mind one bit. If that's a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match. 

RE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring. My shoes were plain nude peep-toe pumps.

After dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding I attended as an adult, I’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few Dillard's jams over and over, desperately trying to style them into something fresh. Enter RTR and this lil beauty.

PROS: GORGEOUS detail. Lace for days. Great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business. Beautiful open back and delicate chest detail. Love the two pintucks on the front. Also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling. Tons of compliments! Looks pretty with pearls as well. AWESOME to dance in. Both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling out.
  
CONS: I’m gifted in the booty department, so I was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum. The waist was defining but not as dramatic as I would have liked. I also have a smaller chest and found that I needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top. The lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain, so watch out! 

HMM: There’s a bustier / inlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived, but I was able to make it work without it!

1. The bust area is extremely loose.  It is simply two flaps that cross over each other so if you're not a full D cup (I'm a size 12-14 and am a 36 C) the flaps will sag open and you will show your undergarments.  I had to safety pin the front in two places so that it would stay close and unfortunately was self-conscious about it throughout the night (especially while dancing).
2. Because of the way the dress is designed, the hem is uneven if the bust is not filled out.  If the front starts to sag (which it did for me) it causes the whole dress to shift longer in the front and pulls up the back.  Being 5'10, I specifically rented a dress that was long on some shorter girls.  However, because the dress kept shifting to the front, I had to continually pull the dress down in the back because it kept riding up and getting shorter and shorter.
3. The material is surprisingly clingy and if you are fuller on bottom, it shows every line.  I would recommend a body shaper that allows a smooth line all the way from the waist to the thigh area (a leotard shape that just sucks in your tummy will cause a significant panty line).

I was very happy with how this dress hugged my curves. I have a very true hourglass figure, with just a bit of a tummy. This draping on this dress concealed EVERYTHING! I'm not kidding! It also helped with my ""less than perfect"" arms. 

This dress has a good amount of stretch. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the amount of layers. The pictures don't really showcase that the bottom has three layers: one stops right at your bum (so be careful if you are bottom heavy -- it will cut into you), the second helps show less leg behind the slit, and the top lies as you would expect. 

Overall, I would recommend this dress. It was very comfortable and it didn't feel too heavy. I am big busted (36DD-36DDD) and I was able to wear a Spanx singlet and a normal bra. 

Overall, I would definitely re-rent this dress for a different occasion. I would especially recommend this dress for any event that is taking place in a ballroom or a hotel (which are notoriously COLD). I was comfortable throughout the event, while many of my friends complained of being cold. ",hourglass,Black tie beauty!,gown,67.0,21,36.0,2014-08-03,3.0,2,large,3,1

The bust on it was a bit big, but it was a simple fix for me, where I simply basted a couple of loose stitches on the inside, which were easily removed before I sent the dress back. Or someone without sewing skills, a padded bust cup insert would have been another good solution. 

The dress was understandably very wrinkled when it arrived, but was easy to steam/iron for a perfect look. 

Another ""pro"" for this dress is that it's so stunning, you really don't need flashy accessories to complete the look. Strappy, nude heels and a nice pair of earrings are all you need.

The pros are exactly how beautiful it is, that it is really warm for winter, and it has an overall very flattering fit. It is rather short by the way, so dark thighs may be a necessity. It has some cons though. The first one is that it has a weird fit in the arms. The opening between shoulder and arm is rather large, but then the fabric compresses the arm itself. So, it accommodates a thicker arm around the shoulder, but not at the biceps area. This was annoying, and I felt pretty uncomfortable wearing it because of that. Two other cons, which are no big deal: the sleeves are really long. It's ok for wearing it standing up, but if you need your hands at all you will have to bring the sleeves up, which is not very easy to do with this dress, and also loses part of  its charm. The second is that the dress is warm indeed, so you will feel hot if you are either walking a lot, dancing or just being at a warm enough venue. One thing which may interest some: I was 6 months pregnant when I wore it, and it does not compress the belly at all.

The jumpsuit was true to size; however, the it was a little long so, heel height is key or fashion tape for the hem. The material also wrinkled easily which was a con for me. Overall this jumpsuit fits better than most and the material is most similar to crepe so, it did not add warmth, but kept me warmer than I would have been if I opted to wear a dress.
